 * @property-read SchemaTypeList<Demand|Offer>                                         $offers                      An offer to provide this itemâ€”for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.
 * @property-read SchemaTypeList<Audience>                                             $audience                    An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created.

In the case of [[ProductModel]], this is a pointer (from a ProductModel) to a base product from which this product is a variant. It is safe to infer that the variant inherits all product features from the base model, unless defined locally. This is not transitive. In the case of a [[ProductGroup]], the group description also serves as a template, representing a set of Products that vary on explicitly defined, specific dimensions only (so it defines both a set of variants, as well as which values distinguish amongst those variants). When used with [[ProductGroup]], this property can apply to any [[Product]] included in the group.
 * @property-read SchemaTypeList<URL|ImageObject>                                      $colorSwatch                 A color swatch image, visualizing the color of a [[Product]].
